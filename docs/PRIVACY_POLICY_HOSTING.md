# Hosting Your Privacy Policy

You have several options to host your privacy policy:

## Option 1: GitHub Pages (Recommended - Free)

1. **Enable GitHub Pages:**
   - Go to your GitHub repo: https://github.com/tggreene/hype
   - Settings → Pages
   - Source: Deploy from a branch
   - Branch: `main` (or your default branch)
   - Folder: `/ (root)`
   - Click Save

2. **Your privacy policy URL will be:**
   ```
   https://tggreene.github.io/hype/privacy-policy.html
   ```

3. **Use this URL in App Store Connect**

## Option 2: Raw GitHub File (Quick but less ideal)

You can use the raw GitHub URL:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tggreene/hype/main/privacy-policy.html
```

However, this shows raw HTML. Better to use GitHub Pages.

## Option 3: Your Own Website

If you have a website, upload `privacy-policy.html` and use that URL.

## Option 4: Free Hosting Services

- **Netlify Drop**: Drag and drop the HTML file
- **Vercel**: Connect your GitHub repo
- **GitHub Pages**: (See Option 1 above)

## Quick Test

After hosting, test that the URL:
- ✅ Loads in a browser
- ✅ Shows formatted content (not raw HTML)
- ✅ Is publicly accessible (no login required)

Then use this URL in App Store Connect as your Privacy Policy URL.
